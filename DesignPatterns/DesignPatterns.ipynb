    "3 reasons that we don't talk about patterns much in Python: \n",
    " 1. patterns are baked into the Language and the standard library\n",
    " 1. provided by frameworks (i.e. Django & MVC)\n",
    " 1. we avoid large complex applications\n",
    " \n",
    "Book \"A Pattern Language\" Christopher Alexander (1977) on Architecture (buildings)\n",
    " \n",
    "Book: \"Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-oriented Software\" Gamma, Helm, Johnson & Vlissides (The Gang of Four)\n",
    "\n",
    "not all patterns are Object-oriented patterns.  Using a_dict.get() instead of checking if key exists first.  Avoiding elses in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "OO Design patterns maxim: \"Program to an interface not an implementation\".  With duck-typing in Python, this is largely automatic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern Types:\n",
    "1. Creational\n",
    "1. Structural\n",
    "1. Behavioral\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creational Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "No separate syntax for creating instances of a class (no new keyword)\n",
    "\n",
    "having a new keywords means you can't do things like:\n",
    "1. return another class\n",
    "1. Always return the same instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"So most 'creational patterns' are contortions to avoid making brittle new calls in your C++/Java code\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Prototype pattern - Creating new objects based on existing objects.  The standard library's copy module takes care of this for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Builder pattern - you feed the builder info on what you want built and it takes care of the gory details of linking the various instances together.  Brandon has an example of building an XML document. At about 40 minutes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Left off at 40 min in\n",
    "\n",
    "Designed away by language: Abstract Factory, factory method\n",
    "Trivial: Singleton, Prototype\n",
    "Useful: Builder\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structural Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adapter:** Wrap a class so it behaves like another.  i.e. wrap a socket that it has a `read` and `write` method like a file instead of the socket's normal `send` and `recv` methods.  (43 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bridge:** Use subclass for 1 purpose only.  You don't want a bunch of classes like:\n",
    "* WindowsButton\n",
    "* WindowsBorderedButton\n",
    "* LinuxButton\n",
    "* LinuxBorderedButton\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixins may allow your better way to achieve this\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composite:** A class whose instances are designed to lock together in a tree.  Like `Node` elements in a Document Object Model.  Very common in the Python World\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fascade:** An object that hides a complex tree or network of objects.  i.e. etrees root.find() and root.iter() that handle the details of searching and iterating through the tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flyweight:** small immutable object that may be used in a variety of contexts.\n",
    "(I think named tuples would be a good way to accomplish this).  python does this for small less than 100 integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proxy:** proxy object wraps another object called the subject and accepts method calls and attribute lookups on behalf of the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "proxying can be done dynamically via `__getattr()__` without having to write a bunch of proxying methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "several examples of proxy within standard library (weakref.proxy, xmlrpc), used in zope library.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decorator:** not to be confused with Python @decorators.  Simlar to proxy (same methods and attributes), not not completely transparent (alters data coming in and out of subject, masks the behavior of underlying subject) tend to be in the 'glue' code of an application rather than in a library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavioral Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chain of Responsibility:** pass a request along a chain of objects until one decides to handle it.  (used in GUIs and DOMs to handle mouse clicks)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command:** Consider a system to do do 2D drawings.  Instead of just calling a `draw_line` function, instantiate an instance of a \n",
    "\n",
    "Before\n",
    "```python\n",
    "draw_line(0, 0, 5, 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After\n",
    "```python\n",
    "line1 = DrawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n",
    "line1.do()\n",
    "command_history.append(line1)\n",
    "\n",
    "last_command = command_history.pop(-1)\n",
    "last_command.undo()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpreter:** build a component that can parse a language and execute the command found within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterator:**  Concept baked into Python.  In Python this is anything that implements a `__next__` \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = list(range(5))\n",
    ">>> [s for s in dir(a) if 'iter' in s]\n",
    "['__iter__']\n",
    ">>> iterator = iter(a)\n",
    ">>> [s for s in dir(itr) if 'next' in s]\n",
    "['__next__']\n",
    ">>> next(iterator)\n",
    "0\n",
    ">>> next(iterator)\n",
    "1\n",
    ">>> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "'__iter__' as a generator\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyIterable:\n",
    "    def __iter__(self):\n",
    "        for i in self.contents:\n",
    "            yield i\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mediator:** mentioned at 1:03 in Brandon's talk.  Need to see some code to understand\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memento:** record of an objects inner state.  Allows calling code to restore an object to it's earlier state.\n",
